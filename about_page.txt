ABOUT SCREENS BY KAIDAN

Bringing Fresh Air In and Keeping Bugs Out—One Screen at a Time!

WHO IS KAIDAN?

From the Owner:
You might be wondering—who or what is “Kaidan”? The name comes from a blend of my two daughters’ first names, Kailey and Jordan. In a way, Kaidan is really me—Mike Chillinsky.

In the 1990s, I opened a cabinet shop, but “Chillinsky Woodworking” wasn’t the easiest name to remember. So, we came up with “Kaidan,” and Kaidan Design Inc. was born. Today, Screens by Kaidan operates as a d.b.a. of Kaidan Design Inc., continuing a legacy of quality craftsmanship and reliable service under a name that means family.

WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU!
